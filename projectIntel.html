            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Intel is a global company with product retailers in nearly every country. On the Intel Technology Provider (ITP) registration form, the address template format did not allow for a variety of global address structures, resulting in poor data quality and geocode accuracy which is used for location services to provide local resources, training, and support.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
              The generic address fields were removed and replaced with the google address API which allows the user to put in first a country, then address fields specifically relevant to their country. If their business location does not have a written address, they can use the language-agnostic google maps interface to place a pin onto the location of their business. The pin is captured by GPS coordinates and recorded in the backend on form submit.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              This was a complex project involving <a href="https://www.bchannels.com/" target="_blank">B-Channels</a> (an agency who did initial user research), our internal sales/marketing + development teams, and <a href="https://www.sapientrazorfish.com/" target="_blank">Razorfish</a>. I worked to create the user flows, personas, and mockups based on my knowledge of our user base and the research documents. I gave these requirements to Razorfish, and collaborated in client meetings as we iterated on the prototype. I also coordinated with our internal dev team. Finally, I played a role in the Q/A process to ensure the acceptance criteria were met and coordinated translation and release of the new webpage with my counterparts in all other world regions.

              Intel’s existing ITP registration form has a standard address template for all countries worldwide, which does not allow for non-traditional formatted addresses.

              Once we had an acceptable prototype, our front end team in India took the baton. My role at this point was to meet up with their product owner periodically to see if they needed any clarification or needed to compromise on the design.

          </div>
          <p>
            No one had taken the time to actually define what they were in Hex, RGB, or even a Pantone variation for print. In an effort to standardize these colors, I nailed down the exact color and put it in the design guide.
          </p>
          <p>
          I also chose appropriate lighter versions and neutral black/grey/whites.

                The challenging part of this color palette was the sheer number of hues. I created a logo with each of the colors, but realistically we only used about half of them, mainly for the business cards. The main logo remained the darker blue version.

            As soon as the front end team had a testable coded beta version up and running, I recruited coworkers or really just anyone who wanted to have fun in the lab with me.

            We rolled out the cart with a bunch of diffently sized devices and went to work seeing if the interface would break at any point in the process.

            I found this work pretty dang fun, but I was naive to hope they would fix every little perfectionist problem I found :D

              In the grand scheme of things, I think this project was impactful, and helped bring our sign-up page up to standards in branding and responsiveness. It also changed the type of data we colleced, and made it smoother for people already part of a company to enroll.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the length of time it took to roll out the project was definitely more waterfall-style, especially in the way it was rolled out. There were more moving parts than I thought was necessary, with way too many time-zones involved which made communication challenging.
