              It is surprising that in this day and age, there isn’t a widespread app for bridging the gap between driving to nearest to your destination, parking, and actually arriving to your destination.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              You know when you’re in a rush and need to park? You circle around, stressing out to find a (hopefully) cheap spot. Finding a place for $1/hr cheaper makes your day. When you do park, you don’t always know if it's free or not, where the parking meter is, or how much it will cost. Sometimes, you will not remember exactly where you parked, or when your ticket expires.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
              Copilot is an app that knows the street parking availability and can direct you to spots nearest to your destination that are most likely open. It reduces the stress of finding and paying for a spot by having the information and payment functionality at your fingertips, whether you are familiar with a city or not.
            </p>

            <h2>User Survey</h2>
            <h3>Who are my users, and what’s their take?</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            To get a better idea about my target audience, I put out a survey on <a href="http://www.freeonlinesurveys.com">freeonlinesurveys.com</a> (which isn’t actually free if you want some sweet features). I started out asking general questions such as <strong>“Do you drive a vehicle?”</strong>, and <strong>“How many times a week do you park a vehicle?”</strong> These questions helped me not only to guide testers to appropriate follow-up questions, but also to segment them into groups explaining their opinions and behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out that the way people answered questions about most useful features of a parking app and frustrations while parking were highly correlated with frequency and whether or not they typically paid for parking.

            The name “copilot” transpired out of the idea that the user should feel like there’s a real human copilot sitting there helping them find a spot, pay for it, and extend if necessary.

              <p>
                I decided on a single typeface because Copilot is not a very text-heavy app, and I wanted to reduce time-to-load. I did try a couple of combinations, but I always came back to Titillium Web as the one typeface that worked the best.
              </p>
              <p>
                The font-face has a sans-serif softness but rigid end caps and geometrically even strokes that exude regularity. The combination goes well with the trust, happy, and functional vibe I’m trying to convey with the color palette.

              </div>
              <p>
                There’s a very big element of trust with apps like this. It has payment and car information to start, but also has to deliver timely information and make sure the user doesn’t get a ticket. Users of competitors have very little patience with failures associated with parking apps, so I wanted to really drive home the idea of trust, calm and idealistic/happy with the colors blue and yellow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also include neutrals that go well with both of these colors and a functional color palette for errors or success messages. The app rides the line of over-communicating with the user in cases when a parking session starts, is extended, is running out, and so on. As was evident in my first round of testing, the lack of communication is a surefire way to alienate and cause doubt.

              The cycle started as soon as I drew the first wireframe sketch. I iterated on design versions working to reducing user confusion and narrowing the scope towards a minimum viable product. This meant that only the most important user flows made it into the final design. Not surprisingly, none of the flows stayed exactly the same as I had originally imagined them.

                Given users’ reactions and the research that went into it, Copilot could be a viable app given the data exists in the backend. In fact, BMW + INRIX is doing <a href="http://inrix.com/blog/2018/07/inrix-parking-path/" target="_blank">exciting work</a> that shows a similar interface they are already working on using ultrasonic sensors to supply parking availability information among other sources.

                  To keep wording and navigation behavior as user expected proved to be very difficult, even with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ONQ-qdsHT7d_lHijeHhksYV0jpj40WTIu6XRyJ19gYg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">content strategy</a> written in the research phase of the project.

                <li class="pSpacing">
                  Testing should always be done on the medium that the app is indended for. i.e. if the app is meant to be for touch screen, don't test on a desktop with mouse-input. I did this with my first test-taker, but realized their frustration stemmed from using the wrong device for the test.

                <li class="pSpacing">
                  When testing the high-fidelity prototype, <strong>giving testers a “tutorial” of the testing interface would have improved testing quality.</strong> There was a lot of confusion resulting in the lack of trust around the fact that the prototype doesn’t work fully like an app even though it looks like a finished product. Reminding them during the test wasn’t enough.

                  <strong>People who don’t usually pay for parking will go to great lengths to find free parking in a city</strong>. They are willing to walk distances if they can find a free spot. Free parking should be easier to find visually, perhaps via a map filter to show only free spots.

                  <strong>It is hard to be unbiased.</strong> While waiting for survey responses, I thought I’d make three personas differentiated by how often they parked. Seems logical, right?

                  The depiction of parking volume needs visual improvements. Every tester said that they thought it was traffic instead of parking volume. Some of the ideas we discussed:
                  <br />-- Make the color scheme slightly different than google maps traffic
                  <br />-- Show colors on both sides of the street
                  <br />-- The coloration could be well-styled dashed lines
