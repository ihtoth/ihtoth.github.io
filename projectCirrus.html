        Cirrus is a cloud storage app that is simple and gesture- friendly.
        It is aimed towards viewing, sharing, and uploading data into a
        secure space available from any device.

        <h3>Hey can you include <span>everything?</span></h3>
        <p>
          I was asked to provide direction to a startup client with no previous products.
          Their vague request asked me to explore the market, and provide a final app design
          including the laundry list of functionalities they thought people wanted.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <h3> No, let’s pick key features, and create a targeted look.</h3>
        <p>
          Although this was a daunting task, it gave me the opportunity to discover the market.
          As one snarky user remarked in my initial survey: “Cloud storage is a standard.
          Calling it ‘Cloud storage’ is almost outdated, it's just known as storage.”
          The research revealed a niche Cirrus could exist: providing a better
          sharing experience and a more flexible way to organize content. Using the design process,
          I created an MVP to showcase key must-have features of the app.

        <h3>Discovering what the user would actually use.</h3>
        <p>
          Taking the long list of requirements, my first job was to find what users liked, wanted, and were most peeved about. This was also a good time to find out what elements were top-of-mind for users vs. just nice-to-haves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing up a healthy set of questions, I sent texts to friends, family, posted on facebook, reddit, a couple slack channels to solicit responses to my google survey. Luckily my efforts were rewarded by thirty-three respondents, 75% of which already use Google Drive. Score!

        <p>
          I used sketching to be messy, brainstorming on how a user might go about completing tasks such as signing up, adding content, and sharing something.
        </p>
        <img id=OnboardingSketch />
        <p>
          This was the part where I had interaction ideas handwritten sideways, upside down, with arrows pointing a lot of directions. Distilling the essence, I used draw.io to digitize the flows.
        </p>
        <div class="twoColumns">

              I ended up deviating from both of these user flows. Here is what I learned: the flows are just to get the first draft out the door. As I compared other products and tested Cirrus with users, the interactions evolved to be simpler. For example, I ditched the ‘user-dialogue’ when uploading something.

        <p>
          So far, we have the user flows according to user personas and user stories. To help me with wireframing, I needed to map out my content into specific pages. This is called the sitemap, which just outlines proposed content of each page, and how they may be connected to one-another. I used an app called Flow Mapp.

          <span>Green</span> = Items depicted on wireframe, and in high fidelity mockups.
          <span>Turquoise</span> = Pages visible to non-cirrus users, when a user shares an item with them.

            Finally! Lots of research has gone into getting to this point. I relied heavily on my sitemap, user flows, and user stories as I started to sketch out what my pages might look like using old fashioned paper and pen. These are different ideas how I may lay out my user dashboard.

                I finally ended up using “Add folder or file”. Although I was trying to be minimalist, the test results showed that the extra couple words were necessary. Without them, some testers didn’t quite get it.

                In my first iteration, the quick tools were always visible. I revised the mockup so they only appear for a row when hovering on a row (desktop solution). For touch-only screens and mobile, a different solution would have to be implemented.

              At this point, I thought I had most of my wireframes ready to create a click-through design, but there are so many more slightly different screens I created when I finally brought these things to life. For example: hovering over something that changes color. Or making a newly added file appear on the dashboard. Moral of the story is that <span class=bold-500>it will take longer to make than you think.</span>

        <h3>Best done on the couch with a cup of tea.</h3>
        <p>
          Taking a pause from the layout and content iterations, I dove into creating a brand for Cirrus. At this time, I already had the name “Cirrus” in mind. Cirrus is a type of high-flying light-whispy cloud. I wanted my users to feel light, elegance when using the application. I used a mind map to come up with more words and ideas to accompany Cirrus.

          <h3>I took a wrong turn</h3>
          <p>
            Probably from over thinking the whole strategy, I was trying too hard to avoid the analogy to ice and fragility. Instead, I tried to create more of a grounded feel, and pivoted my design for more earthy tones.
          </p>

          <p>
            After consulting with my mentor and some friends, I realized that I had lost the wispy, light feel that would resonate with my users. Terra was a name and logo which would work better for for a landscaping company, something where you could hold the product in your hand. Holding a laptop doesn’t count.

            <p>
              The whole time I was sketching Terra, I had this gut feeling that it was all wrong. Even diving into it, I knew I was taking a risk, but thought to myself - I’ll never know unless I try.  Lesson: trust your gut, and take risks as long as you have enough time to turn back around.

          Even though I had gone pretty far in the wrong direction, having digitized my sketches and was already matching typefaces, I went back to the drawing board one morning with a hot tea in my hand, my mind still in a sort of sleepy-dreaming state. It was here that I came up with these sketches. Picking the top circled, I digitized them. I was suprised how fast this all matriculated! Like it was a baby waiting to be born.

          I used the typeface Quicksand Regular for the words Cirrus, but modified the kerning manually so the letters look more optically evenly spaced out. This typeface was most analogous to the logo, which I also trapped into a circle with similar thickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was attractive to keep the C cradled in the curve of the cloudlike fingers, ultimately, the circle worked better in a standalone way, and makes the logo more versatile overall.

          Initially, I picked Raleway and Montserrat as Title and Body text respectively, but learned quickly that there was not really a compelling reason to pull both those fonts in (extra download overhead!) because they were so familiar. Montserrat had enough weight variety to do the heavy lifting in all typography.

You know that gut feeling. Yeah, it felt gross. I ended up ditching this color, and picking a bright pink with a couple different shades used to draw attention.

          Having part in this project from its inception to developer handoff, it was crazy to see how much work goes into even putting a pixel on the page that will actually see day of light in production.
        </p>
        <p>
          With colors, typography, a solid logo, basic wireframes and a list of things to fix, I sat down to design the high fidelity mockups. I started with the easy stuff:

        <h3>Mobile Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
          Next, I changed my perspective, literally - to what the dashboard may look like on a mobile device. Although this interaface wasn’t the main focus, it was important to start thinking small screen too.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if I thought up a fancy solution on the big screen that would *suck* on the mobile. I didn’t want to have to alter the look too much. The users did say they want this app available on any device.

        <p>
          All jokes aside, I ran this test before I did any branding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like you can’t move the foundation of a house once the walls are up without having to start over, running low fidelity tests gave me a good base on which to create the branded high-fi prototypes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the results combined from four user tests.
        </p>
        <article class="green2Bg">
          <h4>The Good</h4>
          <p>

            <span class="bold-500">Dragging-Dropping.</span> Test takers had trouble with how to move items. In the above screenshots, the folder icon wasn’t understood. Instinctively, they said they should be able to drag the name of the file over a folder to drop it in. This included not only the line item, but in the breadcrumbs too. Dragging is more intuitive than clicking buttons.

          The best part about being a UX designer is that if you are not sure how something should work, the best way to find out is to test users. It’s great that we don’t have to invent it all by ourselves!
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought I had ironed out everything by the time I was ready to test my high-fidelity prototypes, but there’s always something to tweak, especially when bringing in new testers who haven’t tested the product before.

        <h3>The Design Process really works.</h3>
        <p>
          I am amazed how far users’ feedback combined with my experience and studying have brought this product where I truly believe it could compete with “the big ones” like google and dropbox if implemented correctly, and further iterated on using the same testing principles.
        </p>
        <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>There’s no such thing as too much sketching</li>
          <li>Trust your gut instinct; stop and go back, or keep iterating if it doesn’t feel right.</li>
          <li>The process will take 2 or 3 times as long as you think. Most people don’t get why.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What's Next?</h4>
        <p>
          There are many more user stories in the queue that haven’t been implemented. That is where I would go to if there is more time, or a second design sprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Designer, I would go into more details and thinking out test cases and acceptance criteria for the developer to use when iterating on their code to match to the original user stories.
