              Inreach Solutions is a tiny company with a fiercely motivated hazel-eyed lady at its helm. The love and care she extends to clients are way beyond “just business,” which creates wholesome trust between the company and its customers.
              <strong>Passion and a playfulness were the most important feelings the director wanted to continue to convey while rebranding her company.</strong>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Their main product is SAM:
              a salesforce-like Content Management System (CMS) for foster/adoption agencies.
              The branding guidelines were sparse at best: they had a 90’s-look logo and some basic
              colors they used in the product.
              <strong>As a growing company, the need for a full design guide
              became clear as multiple employees struggled to stay brand-consistent.</strong>
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
              I met with the director to understand what feelings the brand should continue to deliver. As a result, I redesigned their logo, chose a fitting typeface, created friendly icons for their new website, made a new letterhead & business card, among other marketing material.
              All of these guidelines are in the design guide and implemented at <a href="http://inreachsolutions.com" target="_blank">inreachsolutions.com</a>.

            <h3>Should we start from scratch?</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            When first assessing what direction to take the logo, the director presented me with this icon.
          </p>
          <img src="./projects/inreach/images/InreachSolutionsOriginalLogo.png" class="d-medium m-medium centered"/>
          <p>
            I drew a few sketches as potential alternatives.

          <p>
            We decided that the original image wasn’t a bad one, but needed a facelift that would be more modern and simple. </p>
          <p>
            I opened the SVG of the blue figure in illustrator, using the pen tool to simplify the vector outline then adding a black fill. Next, I experimented with adding typography and color.</p>

              <p>
                The most challenging part of the logo redesign was deciding what text should go along with the icon. Unfortunately, the name of the company was very long, and the software they offered has a different name altogether. In fact, most customers didn’t even recognize “InReach Solutions” - the name of the company - but knew exactly what ”SAM” - the name of the software - was.

            We decided that because SAM was the most recognizable, it would need to be the largest text. However, I had to wriggle in the company’s name somehow.
          </p>
          <img src="./projects/inreach/images/Logo_Showcase_Printing.jpg" class="d-large m-large centered"/>
        <h3>Naming Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes even the employees would shorten the company name to “InReach”. So which would it be? We’d have to stick with it, and stay consistent. </p>
        <p>
          I twisted the text in many directions, ran preference tests with the employees and director, as well as friends with a good eye for design.

              We finally settled on this one, which leads the eye in a circular fashion, and provides good contrast between the text and vector image. This version also uses the typeface Montserrat we selected.

              SAM was already using a rainbow-like variation of 6 colors. The director wanted to keep it the same which worked well with the playful vibe of the company. The only problem was that these colors were constantly being sampled off this lovely swatch.

            No one had taken the time to actually define what they were in Hex, RGB, or even a Pantone variation for print. In an effort to standardize these colors, I nailed down the exact color and put it in the design guide.
          </p>
          <p>
          I also chose appropriate lighter versions and neutral black/grey/whites.

                The challenging part of this color palette was the sheer number of hues. I created a logo with each of the colors, but realistically we only used about half of them, mainly for the business cards. The main logo remained the darker blue version.

          Along with the website, the company was also redoing their help pages. Since the software had many bells and whistles, the customers often had questions about how to do certain things. They already had an arsenal of articles, but the organization and look were not in accordance to this new design guide. I started with drawing custom icons for these pages, also to be used on the website and product as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The icons I created were playful, semi-irregular, and followed the color palette I defined in the design guide.

            I did have one instance of utter failure when I attempted to design the front of a little notebook the director was to hand out as marketing swag. Misreading the direction to "do whatever", I thought the team wanted to give me creative freedom and make it my own project. Attempting to make something cute, I drew this little guy all over the page:

          <img src="./projects/inreach/images/ScoutBookFirstDraft.png" class="d-large m-large centered"/>
          <p>
            However, the response from the team was overwhelmingly “Wow, that’s creepy!” “Maybe stick with the words only?” “This does not feel like SAM!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was one day to the deadline so we didn’t have too much time to reconsider and ended up with what I would not consider my best work by a long shot.

                Learnings: This is a classic case of the customer not really knowing what they want. Even if the customer doesn’t know at first, as a designer, I should hold a brainstorming session and discuss ideas until they can provide better direction, then involve them in each step of the way towards the final product.
