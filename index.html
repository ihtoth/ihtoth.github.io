        <span class="bold">Graphic Design.</span>  I don’t want to create anything that wastes people’s time.
        As a designer, it is my responsibility to avoid design patterns that cause anxiety and confusion.

      <p>
        My first job out in the wild was an Automation Software Engineer at Intel.
        As a newly minted adult, I wanted most of all to please my coworkers and managers.
        I did exactly what I was told: learn fast, and program things due yesterday.
        In the process, I ignored certain thoughts which got louder and louder as time passed:
        Why do the users turn off our automation and do things manually essentially abandoning
        the software we wrote? Why am I not allowed to talk to them and watch them work on
        new releases to work out any kinks?
      <p>
        When I voiced my concern to management, they loudly ignored what I said,
        citing my proposed improvements a “waste of time” and “no competition,
        internal customers…it doesn’t matter...” and then put me on a project the furthest
        away from UX they could find: how to take the user out of the picture entirely.
        Their vision was a lights-off factory.
      </p>
      <p>
      Needless to say, this attitude and short sightedness made my blood boil. Yes I get
      all the reasons, but it didn’t mean I was ok with it. I finally realized that this
      was not the place for me, because the type of work I enjoyed the most: talking to
      customers about frustrations and ultimately design for them, was at risk of falling
      off the priority list entirely.

      <h2>2</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">UX Ethics.</span> I have a degree in this too. Back in the day,
        apps and interface design were in their infancy, left mainly for the programmer to implement.
        I sort of though it was dumb to design print brochures, so I got a job as a programmer...

      <p>
        Not all apps are created equal: some are confusing, others draw you into an endless scrolling abyss,
        some make you feel overwhelmed by revealing too much visually. My favorite apps are the ones
        I spend the least time with: they tell me what I want to know, help me with making my
        micro-decision, and lets me move on with life. It’s like my favorite shoe that I think
        about when putting on in the morning, but actively forget about while “carrying” it around
        with me all day.
      <p>
        I want to create design that doesn’t include nefarious dark patterns, pulling people in
        like a casino does with a mixture of anxiety and dopamine. I’d rather create
        warm-fuzzy-clarity type design that brings people back because it truly helps
        them reach their goals without distraction. I believe reducing anxiety and depression
        is my purpose as a designer. This doesn’t mean getting rid of technology, but being
        smarter in design to reduce unnecessary screen time thereby allowing for more
        community and human connection.
